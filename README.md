# Awesome Neural Scene Representations
A curated list of papers and open-source resources focused on NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, inspired by [nerf_and_beyond](https://github.com/yangjiheng/nerf_and_beyond_docs). Other classic scene representations are also listed here due to my research interest.

More attention are payed to the **neural surface reconstucion**, **sparse-view reconstrucion**, **neural SLAM** and **scene understanding** of **static scene**. Only milestone works or those I think interesting are listed here. Papers of other topics (e.g., 3D generation, deformable/dynamic representation learning, avatar reconstruction) can be found in [awesome-NeRF](https://github.com/awesome-NeRF/awesome-NeRF), [nerf_and_beyond](https://github.com/yangjiheng/nerf_and_beyond_docs) and [awesome-3D-gaussian-splatting](https://github.com/MrNeRF/awesome-3D-gaussian-splatting).
